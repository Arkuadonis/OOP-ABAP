4. FRIEND Class, DEFFER Keyword:

In general, the protected and private components of a class cannot be accessed outside the class. However, in certain cases, there may be a business requirement to access these components. 
This can be achieved using the FRIEND class feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which allows specific classes to access all components of another class, regardless of their visibility section (protected or private).
The DEFFER keyword is used to inform the system that the class is declared later in the program, rather than at the beginning.

 Example:

*&-------------------------------------------------------------------
*& Report YAK_OOP_FRIEND
*&-------------------------------------------------------------------
REPORT yak_oop_friend.

" Declare class lcl_friend later in the program using DEFERRED
CLASS lcl_friend DEFINITION DEFERRED.

" Declare class lcl_class and specify that lcl_friend is a FRIEND class
CLASS lcl_class DEFINITION FRIENDS lcl_friend.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS m1.  " Public method
  PROTECTED SECTION.
    METHODS m2.  " Protected method
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    METHODS m3.  " Private method
ENDCLASS.

" Implement methods of class lcl_class
CLASS lcl_class IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD m1.
    WRITE:/ 'Public Section Method m1'.
  ENDMETHOD.
  METHOD m2.
    WRITE:/ 'Protected Section Method m2'.
  ENDMETHOD.
  METHOD m3.
    WRITE:/ 'Private section method m3'.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

" Define class lcl_friend and implement its method
CLASS lcl_friend DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS mf.  " Friend class method
ENDCLASS.

CLASS lcl_friend IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD mf.
    WRITE:/ 'Friend class method'.

    " Create an instance of lcl_class
    DATA: lcl_obj TYPE REF TO lcl_class.
    CREATE OBJECT lcl_obj.

    " Call methods of lcl_class
    CALL METHOD lcl_obj->m1. " Public method
    CALL METHOD lcl_obj->m2. " Protected method (accessible due to FRIEND relationship)
    CALL METHOD lcl_obj->m3. " Private method (accessible due to FRIEND relationship)
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

" Main program execution
START-OF-SELECTION.

  " Create an instance of the friend class lcl_friend
  DATA: f_obj TYPE REF TO lcl_friend.
  CREATE OBJECT f_obj.

  " Call the method of the friend class
  CALL METHOD f_obj->mf.
